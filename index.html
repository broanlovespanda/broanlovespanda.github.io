        <h2> Description: </h2>
        <div class="about-information">
          <p> My name is Brian Singer and I am currently a junior at Byram Hills High School. For the past couple of years I have taught myself computer programming and photography. I love working on projects that involve microcontrollers and/or computers. I also enjoy running track and playing ultimate frisbee on the weekends. Recently, I have been focussing on my science research project where I am attempting to detect bruxism (excessive tooth grinding and/or clenching) with a minimal number of electrodes. I am the co-founder of JGrader.com, an online grading system for Java. I am always excited to learn new technologies and programming languages. </p>
        </div>
        <h2> Academics: </h2>
        <div class="about-information">
          <ul>
            <li> I completed the AP Computer Science course at my school a year earlier than the average student and recieved a 5 on the AP exam. </li>
            <li> After taking the course I was invited to become the first AP Computer Science TA. </li>
            <li> The hard work I put into my science research project was recognized by my school when I received the Oustanding Sophmore Award. Only one sophomore is given this award out of a research class of ~50. </li>
            <li> This year I am one of the six MIT THINK SCHOLARS finalists out of over 100 applicants. I was invited to MIT for a week. They gave me the opportunity to meet with professors in the field and present my science research project. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h2> Hobbies and Skills: </h2>
        <div class="about-information">
          <ul>
            <li> Over the past couple of years I have became proficient in the following languages: </li>
            <ul id= "languages">
              <li> C </li>
              <li> C++ </li>
              <li> Java </li>
              <li> HTML and CSS </li>
              <li> Swift </li>
              <li> Javascript (Node.js) </li>
              <li> MATLAB </li>
            </ul>
            <li> I have always taken an interest in photography. During the Summer of 2013 I interned for the photographer Peter Simon. I helped him setup his gear and plan out the photoshoots. Over the course of the internship I learned advanced lighting and composure techniques. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h2> Leadership: </h2>
        <div class="about-information">
          <ul>
            <li> Last summer, I graduated from the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). I went on a 30 day hiking trip deep into Wyoming's backcountry. Over the course of the trip I learned essential skills for both leadership and teamwork. By the end of the trip I hiked with my peers for five days without any instructors. </li>
            <li> Every week I mentor and guide students through programming projects after school. </li>

          <h3>Description:</h3>
          <p> jGrader is a cloud based grading system designed for use within a high school AP Computer Science program. The system allows teachers to easily collect, grade, and provide feedback on assignments. Teachers can execute code submitted by their students directly in their browsers. Over 100 teachers and 600 students use the website. </p>
          <h3>How I built this website: </h3>
          <p> jGrader.com uses a node.js express stack, the database is mySQL and the frontend uses the EJS templating engine with standard javascript (jquery) and CSS. The private git repository is on www.github.com. I have spent over 200 hours on this project. </p>
