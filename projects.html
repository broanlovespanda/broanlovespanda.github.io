            <h2>jGrader</h2>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p> jGrader is a cloud based grading system designed for use within a high school AP Computer Science program. The system allows teachers to easily collect, grade, and provide feedback on assignments. Teachers can execute code submitted by their students directly in their browsers. Over 120 teachers use the website. </p>
            <h3>How I built this website: </h3>
            <p> jGrader.com uses a node.js express stack, the database is mySQL and the frontend uses the EJS templating engine with standard javascript (jquery) and CSS. The private git repository is on www.github.com. I have spent over 200 hours on this project. </p>

            <h2>Process Watch</h2>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p> Most recently, an IT professional and family friend mentioned that he could not find software to effectively track his clients' backups and replications. So I created a website called Process Watch (www.process.watch), which monitors backups and replications by automatically parsing emails sent by client hardware systems. Currently we have eight "beta testers" and the website parses over 50,000 emails a month. By January 2016, I plan to offer it as a commercial product. </p>

            <h2>Helping Hands Club (E-nable)</h2>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p> Last year, my school bought a 3D printer. I read an article in the <i>New York Times</i> Magazine about 3D printing prosthetic hands for children. It is expensive for children born with hand defects to purchase appropriate prosthetics because they outgrow them so quickly. The e-NABLE organization is a small community of 3D printer enthusiasts who design and print inexpensive prosthetic hands for children. My friend and I created the Helping Hands Club; we built a test prosthetic hand and had it approved by e-NABLE. I organize spreadsheets to keep track of the printed parts and teach the club members how to use and maintain the printers. Within weeks, we were building prosthetic hands for patients. We are one of only 20 organizations approved to print hands for patients. Later this year I will make modifications based on patient feedback. </p>

            <h2>Science Research</h2>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p> I created two novel devices that detect bruxism. Bruxism is a disorder in which a patient excessively grinds or clenches their teeth. Symptoms include tooth wear, headaches, back pain, and neck pain. The current devices to detect and treat bruxism are intrusive. My first device is EEG-based and collects data from a single electrode above the left ear. It uses a machine learning algorithm to detect bruxism from the EEG data. The second device uses Eulerian Video Magnification to amplify jaw movement as seen in a video recording (or live video feed) of bruxism. Both techniques appear to be novel approaches for the detection of bruxism. I compared both devices to a commercial bruxism detection device to gauge effectiveness and obtain qualitative user feedback. Both of my devices demonstrated improved efficacy compared to the commercially  available device. I have filed for a preliminary US Patent. The paper is available <a href="Brian Singer Paper.pdf">here</a>. </p>

            <p>Text Editor: Vim (Sometimes I prefer Brackets for frontend developemnt)</p>
            <p>Repository: All projects use a local or online git repository</p>
            <p>Server: All websites use Node.js with the Express framework</p>
            <p>Database: jGrader uses mySQL. Process Watch and Code Genius use MongoDB</p>
            <p>Frontend: All websites currently use the EJS Templating Enginer with standard CSS and javascript (jQuery). I am currently in the process of converting Process Watch to utilize Angular.</p>
            <p>Science Research: The EEG data processing and machine learning algorithms were created using MATLAB. The Eulerian Video Magnification implementation was done in C++ with the OpenCV video framework.</p>
            <p>Helping Hands: All parts were printed using my school's Maker Bot Replicator 2</p>
