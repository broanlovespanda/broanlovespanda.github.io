        <h2> Description: </h2>
        <div class="about-information">
          <p> My name is Brian Singer and I am currently a junior at Byram Hills High School. For the past couple of years I have taught myself computer programming and photography. I love working on projects that involve microcontrollers and/or computers. I also enjoy running track and playing ultimate frisbee on the weekends. Recently, I have been focussing on my science research project where I am attempting to detect bruxism (excessive tooth grinding and/or clenching) with a minimal number of electrodes. I am the co-founder of JGrader.com, an online grading system for Java. I am always excited to learn new technologies and programming languages. </p>

        <h2> Academics: </h2>
        <div class="about-information">
          <ul>
            <li> I completed the AP Computer Science course at my school a year earlier than the average student and recieved a 5 on the AP exam. </li>
            <li> After taking the course I was invited to become the first AP Computer Science TA. </li>
            <li> The hard work I put into my science research project was recognized by my school when I received the Oustanding Sophmore Award. Only one sophomore is given this award out of a research class of ~50. </li>
            <li> This year I am one of the six MIT THINK SCHOLARS finalists out of over 100 applicants. I was invited to MIT for a week. They gave me the opportunity to meet with professors in the field and present my science research project. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h2> Hobbies and Skills: </h2>
        <div class="about-information">
          <ul>
            <li> Over the past couple of years I have became proficient in the following languages: </li>
            <ul id= "languages">
              <li> C </li>
              <li> C++ </li>
              <li> Java </li>
              <li> HTML and CSS </li>
              <li> Swift </li>
              <li> Javascript (Node.js) </li>
              <li> MATLAB </li>
            </ul>
            <li> I have always taken an interest in photography. During the Summer of 2013 I interned for the photographer Peter Simon. I helped him setup his gear and plan out the photoshoots. Over the course of the internship I learned advanced lighting and composure techniques. </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <h2> Leadership: </h2>
        <div class="about-information">
          <ul>
            <li> Last summer, I graduated from the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS). I went on a 30 day hiking trip deep into Wyoming's backcountry. Over the course of the trip I learned essential skills for both leadership and teamwork. By the end of the trip I hiked with my peers for five days without any instructors. </li>
            <li> Every week I mentor and guide students through programming projects after school. </li>
