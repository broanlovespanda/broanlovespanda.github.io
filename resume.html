        <ul>
          <li> I completed the AP Computer Science course at my school a year earlier than the average student and recieved a 5 on the AP exam. </li>

          <li> The hard work I put into my science research project was recognized by my school when I received the Oustanding Sophmore Award. Only one sophomore is given this award out of a research class of ~50. </li>
          <li> This year I am one of the six MIT THINK SCHOLARS finalists out of over 100 applicants. I was invited to MIT for a week. They gave me the opportunity to meet with professors in the field and present my science research project. </li>
