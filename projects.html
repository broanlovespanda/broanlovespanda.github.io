            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p> jGrader is a cloud based grading system designed for use within a high school AP Computer Science program. The system allows teachers to easily collect, grade, and provide feedback on assignments. Teachers can execute code submitted by their students directly in their browsers. Over 120 teachers use the website. </p>
            <h3>How I built this website: </h3>
            <p> jGrader.com uses a node.js express stack, the database is mySQL and the frontend uses the EJS templating engine with standard javascript (jquery) and CSS. The private git repository is on www.github.com. I have spent over 200 hours on this project. </p>

            <h2>Process Watch</h2>
            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p> Most recently, an IT professional and family friend mentioned that he could not find software to effectively track his clients' backups and replications. So I created a website called Process Watch (www.process.watch), which monitors backups and replications by automatically parsing emails sent by client hardware systems. Currently we have eight "beta testers" and the website parses over 50,000 emails a month. By January 2016, I plan to offer it as a commercial product. </p>
            <h3>How I built this website: </h3>
            <p> The most difficult aspect of this project is optomizing the website. Because the server has to parse thousands of emails  </p>

            <p>Text Editor: Vim (Sometimes I prefer Brackets for frontend developemnt)</p>
            <p>Repository: All projects use a local or online git repository</p>
            <p>Server: All websites use Node.js with the Express framework</p>
            <p>Database: jGrader uses mySQL. Process Watch and Code Genius uses MongoDB</p>
            <p>Frontend: All websites currently use the EJS Templating Enginer with standard CSS and javascript (jQuery). I am currently in the process of converting Process Watch to utilize Angular.</p>
            <p>Science Research: The EEG data processing and machine learning algorithms were created using MATLAB. The Eulerian Video Magnification implementation was done in C++ with the OpenCV video framework.</p>
            <p>Helping Hands: All parts were printed using my school's Maker Bot Replicator 2</p>
